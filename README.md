🚀 AI Agents Playground — OpenAI Agents SDK Experiments (TypeScript)

A hands-on collection of TypeScript-based demos and experiments for building, customizing, and orchestrating AI Agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
This repo explores how to create agent workflows, integrate tools, manage memory, run multi-agent systems, and build real-world applications powered by OpenAI models—all implemented in clean, modular TypeScript.

🔍 What’s Inside?

✨ Basic agent setup in TypeScript using the OpenAI Agents SDK
🧠 Custom tools & function calling (search, computation, external APIs, etc.)
🤝 Multi-agent collaboration patterns
🔄 State, memory, and context tracking
🧪 Experimentation with agent behaviors & prompt engineering
🛠️ Local + cloud model support (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
🧩 Real example use cases (chatbots, planners, task executors)

🎯 Goal

To provide a practical TypeScript-based sandbox for learning, testing, and building with AI agents—ideal for developers exploring the OpenAI ecosystem, LLM tool integration, autonomous workflows, and modern agentic application development.
