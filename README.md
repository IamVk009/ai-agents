🚀 AI Agents Playground — OpenAI Agents SDK Experiments

A hands-on collection of demos and experiments for building, customizing, and orchestrating AI Agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK.
This repo explores how to create agent workflows, integrate tools, manage memory, run multi-agent systems, and build real-world applications powered by OpenAI models.

🔍 What’s Inside?

✨ Basic agent setup using the OpenAI Agents SDK

🧠 Custom tools & function calling (search, computation, external APIs, etc.)

🤝 Multi-agent collaboration patterns

🔄 State, memory, and context tracking

🧪 Experimentation with agent behaviors & prompt engineering

🌐 Spring Boot integration (optional) for API-driven agent apps

🛠️ Local + cloud model support (OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)

🧩 Real example use cases (chatbots, planners, task executors)

🎯 Goal

To provide a practical sandbox for learning, testing, and building with AI agents—ideal for developers exploring the OpenAI ecosystem, LLM tool integration, and autonomous workflows.
